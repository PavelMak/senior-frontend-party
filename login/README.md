Hello! First of all I would like to thank you for challenging task. It was great opportunity to increase my Front-End knowledge working on this project. 

My solution created using ReactJS and 'create-react-app' so NPM (NodeJS) is required to launch this project on local machine. I have also used 'axios' to fetch data from provided API and react-router-dom to make navigation and redirection between pages. Project style has been done using 'Bootstrap' with addition of some custom styles made using 'SCSS'. To be honest I am not very familiar with unit test so created only few simple tests with 'Jest' and 'Enzyme'.

Will be grateful if you could review my solution and provide some comments/advices.
Thank you.
